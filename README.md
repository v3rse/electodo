This is just a toy app that I'm using to explore the possibilty of building a [Kite](https://kite.com) clone. This should also expand my knowledge of the NodeJS API.

The [plugin documentation](https://github.com/kiteco/plugins) describes how it works in a bit of detail.

Basically a server runs and the background and handles the business login.

If this all works out I might build another project based on this to mimick as many of Kite features as I can.

In this particular project the server will only talk to Atom and Vim (maybe, really hate VimScript) using plugins I write for them.

I'm thinking of writing a React+Electron front end for the server.
